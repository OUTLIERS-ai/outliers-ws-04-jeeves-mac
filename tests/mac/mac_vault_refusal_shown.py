"""Mac only (fault row 20, build plan V3): when macOS refuses a vault, Jeeves' page says so.

A program that starts by itself on a Mac (Jeeves' start-up file) may be refused the Documents
folder with "Operation not permitted". Python then reads the folder as not there, so the page said
"Your second brain folder is not there" about a vault that was where it should be. It must say
"macOS refused access to <folder>", and never that the vault is missing.

GitHub's test Macs cannot show a real refusal (System Integrity Protection is off there, wave 0a
M5), so the first check makes reading the vault raise the error macOS gives, and the second uses
a folder this user may not read, which the test Macs do refuse.

Run by name only:  python3 -m pytest -q tests/mac/mac_vault_refusal_shown.py
