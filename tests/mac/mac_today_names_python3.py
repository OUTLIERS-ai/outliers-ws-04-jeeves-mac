"""Mac only (fault row 10, build plan V3): the Today panel must not tell a Mac member to type `python`.

With no Today.md in the CRM folder, the Today panel said "In your CRM folder run: python
_engine/today.py --write" (jeeves/vaults.py) and the overview card said the same
(jeeves/static/app.js), on every computer (seen on GitHub's test Macs, 2026-09-24). A Mac has
python3 and no python.

Run by name only:  python3 -m pytest -q tests/mac/mac_today_names_python3.py
