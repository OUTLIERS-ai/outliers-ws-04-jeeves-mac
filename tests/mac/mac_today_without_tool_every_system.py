"""Wave 6 (2026-09-25, Ashley: "Make It So"): on EVERY system, a CRM with no Today list builder is
not told to run it.

A CRM made in the first CRM sessions has no `_engine/today.py`: that program comes with part 7 of
the CRM sessions. The Mac already said so (tests/mac/mac_today_without_tool.py); Windows still told
the member to run `python _engine/today.py --write`, which then fails. With the program there, the
instruction stays, in each system's own words.

Runs on every system. Run by name only:
    python -m pytest -q tests/mac/mac_today_without_tool_every_system.py
(pytest never collects tests/mac/ in a plain run, so the counts the guides print stay true.)
