"""Fault row 11 (build plan V3): Jeeves must not wait 35 seconds for a name look-up before it answers.

Measured 2026-09-24 on all 3 of GitHub's test Macs: Python's socket.getfqdn("127.0.0.1") took
35 seconds on every call, and Python's web server calls it once when it starts, only to fill in a
name nothing here uses. So Jeeves answered 35 seconds after it started, and the checks that wait
15 seconds for it failed (tests/test_fixes.py::test_stop_stops_a_real_jeeves, whose stop found no running record yet and so looked only at the port in the settings file). The server now starts with no name look-up.

This check makes the look-up slow on purpose (30 seconds), so it shows the fault on any computer,
then times how long the server takes to start. It is kept in tests/mac/ and named mac_*.py so a
plain `python -m pytest -q` never runs it and the counts the guides print stay true. Run by name:
  python3 -m pytest -q tests/mac/mac_server_starts_quickly.py
