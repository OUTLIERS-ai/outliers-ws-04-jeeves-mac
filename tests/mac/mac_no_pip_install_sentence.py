"""Wave 6 (build plan V3, fault row 18 kind): the installer's version line must not read as a command.

On every test Mac (exploratory run 36129717441, 2026-09-25) `python3 install.py` printed
"Python 3.14.7 - nothing to pip install." The Mac output check reads "pip install" in a sentence as
a command a member should type. The line now says "nothing to install with pip", as the README has
since wave 0b. The words are the same on every system, so this check runs everywhere.

Run by name only:  python3 -m pytest -q tests/mac/mac_no_pip_install_sentence.py
(pytest never collects tests/mac/ in a plain run, so the counts the guides print stay true.)
