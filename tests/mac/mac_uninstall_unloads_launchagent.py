"""Wave 6 (build plan V3): on a Mac, `install.py --uninstall` must switch the LaunchAgent off, not only delete it.

Found by the Mac guide writer on 2026-09-25: `python3 install.py --uninstall` removed
~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.outliers.jeeves.plist but never told launchd, so `launchctl list` still
showed ai.outliers.jeeves (and a Jeeves it had started kept running) until the next log-out.
The uninstall now asks launchd to unload the job first, then removes the file.

The check never loads a real job: it records the launchctl calls the installer makes, so no
Jeeves is started on the test Mac. It also checks the call is hidden (no window on any system).

Run by name only:  python3 -m pytest -q tests/mac/mac_uninstall_unloads_launchagent.py
(pytest never collects tests/mac/ in a plain run, so the counts the guides print stay true.)
